## General Insights

### Code Reuse Patterns

**What's Most Reusable** (70%+):
- Authentication flow
- Billing/subscription logic
- Database models (Shop, Subscription)
- UI components (forms, tables, modals)
- Utility functions

**What's Least Reusable** (30%):
- App-specific business logic
- Custom API integrations
- Unique features

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-engineering**: Keep it simple, ship fast
2. **Premature optimization**: Optimize after you have users
3. **Scope creep**: Stick to PROJECT_BRIEF.md
4. **Ignoring user feedback**: Test with real merchants early

### Time-Saving Tips

1. **Copy-paste is OK**: Extract to shared after 2nd use
2. **Use existing libraries**: Don't reinvent the wheel
3. **Leverage AI**: ChatGPT/Copilot for boilerplate
4. **Test in dev store**: Catch bugs before production
